# Python Nostr CLI

A simple command-line client for interacting with the Nostr protocol, a decentralized social networking system. This CLI allows you to create users, set profiles, post notes, follow users, list follows, delete profiles, and discover/read feeds, all using a local SQLite database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8 or higher is recommended (tested with Python 3.10).
- Install dependencies using pip:
  ```bash
  pip3 install pynostr==0.7.0 cryptography tornado websocket-client
Dependencies

pynostr==0.7.0: Core library for Nostr protocol interactions.
cryptography: For encrypting/decrypting private keys in the database.
tornado: For WebSocket communication with Nostr relays.
websocket-client: For reliable relay connections.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the Nostr CLI:

1.  Run setup_db.py to create the SQLite database (nostr.db) with tables for users, events, and contacts.
2.  Copy the Fernet key generated by setup_db.py into both generate_user.py and nostrCLI.py.
   (note:  generate_user.py already has a Fernet key for a previous nostr.db I was using to test, it no longer exists, so remove that string and paste in the one that setup_db.py gives you).
3.  Run "python3 generate_user.py" to make a user.  It will prompt you for a username.
4.  Run "nostrCLI.py" for a basic client menu - you should publish a profile first, then try the discovery feed.
